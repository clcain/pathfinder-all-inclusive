# pathfinder-all-inclusive
An object-oriented path finding application written in Python to find a route from source to destination passing through all possible locations

This application has the ability to find paths between source and destination 2D coordinates. It will print out all viable paths upon completion. It supports spaces where duplicate visits are allowed and allows the user to specify the spaces that are avaiable. Paths are composed of North/South/East/West adjacent locations.
